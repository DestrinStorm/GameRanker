Download all games over certain ranking, less expansions
I "shuffled" the games and began pitting one game against another...
"Which of these games do I want to play more?"
That created two piles:
	like
	not as much
I then shuffled the 'not as much' pile and pitted those games against each other,
	putting the positive response games into the 'like' pile and creating a new 'not so much' pile.
When finished, I once again shuffled the 'not so much' pile and ran the process one final time.
The games that ended up in the final 'not so much' are dropped from the system...
And then it starts all over again...
Narrow to 100. From that point on, each round worked down to 2-3 games to be "dropped"
	of course, they dropped into a position on my top 100 games list!
